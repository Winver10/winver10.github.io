Hello, everyone, I'm back now!

So, this time. I tried to use the search engin from Russia called **[Yandex](yandex.com)**.

I have to say, it's a good search engin.

But, it's not as good as Google and DuckDuckGo. Because it cannot reach some websites form Chinese; and for some reason, I cannot visit some famous website like YouTube, Wiki, Niconico, and so on, but the mainly results in it are from these website. So I very very want to have a search engin to able reach any result I want.

So what can I use now?

I'm afraid that I just can use Biying(Bing in China, [cn.bing.com](cn.bing.com). I have to tell you the experience in Biying is not good at all, because it always show me some ads and some bad results, and **IT'S DIFFRENT FORM BING!** But it's the biggest search engin in China now, because the search engin, Baidu, [www.baidu.com](www.baidu.com), has the worse experience. You can imagine by yourself.) now.

OK, I just found there are many services in Yandex, like Yandex Video, Yandex Maps, and so on. But...wait! I cannot visit Yandex Video! It's blocked in China!

OK, I also can use the Yandex Mail and Translate. Why? Because some other services use the main URL "yandex.com", but the Yandex Mail use the main URL "mail.yangdex.com".

So what do I want to tell you? I don't know. I just to express my self.

Have a nice day!
